This extension is an email Tracker Blocker, hence the name: Trocker!

Tracking your emails to know if the receiver has seen them or not is awesome, so is being immune to it! Trocker gives you the latter!

Trocker is Open Source. Source Code available at: https://github.com/trockerapp/trocker

Trocker keeps you safe in most webmails, including Gmail, Yahoo! and Outlook.com.

Trocker is very efficient as it only gets activated when a tracker is detected.

Short Explanation:
You can trust us! We won't let hidden trackers track your emails. We don't in any way collect or store information about you or how you use the internet. The code is not obfuscated and you are encouraged to check it out for yourself using Chrome Developer Tools.

Long Explanation:
Some email tracker track emails by injecting an invisible small image in the mail that is hosted in a specific address in their server. They know when the email is opened by looking at the download requests of the injected images on their servers. 
Trocker (as a lovely Tracker Blocker) stops this simply by blocking those image links from being loaded. It finds those injected images by looking at the url and matching the url pattern with the tracking servers that host injected images.
If you yourself are a user of these tracking services (you track emails you send others), your service wouldn't be affected and will work fine. Trocker would only defend you from OTHERS tracking you.
No one will be able to know when and if you open their emails if you enable Trocker. Ofcourse we are currently supporting only a limited (but growing) set of trackers and if someone uses other services we won't be able to stop them from tracking you.

Trocker needs permission to all tabs in order to be able to detect and prevent any tacking images from being loaded from any of the tabs. 
But you are safe! There is absolutely no outbound internet access and we neither gather nor use any data about you or your browsing behaviour. 
The source codes of this extension are not obfuscated and people familiar with javascript are more than welcome to check them out and make sure there are no suspicious activities being done.
We created this because we wanted to be able to say "No" to trackers and you are more than welcome to use it!
